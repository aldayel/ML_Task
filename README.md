# Task 1: üçÑ Mushroom Classification

A machine learning project to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics.

---

## üìå Introduction

This project aims to build a classification model that can accurately identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using a set of categorical features describing its appearance.

The dataset used is the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 22 categorical features for over 8,000 mushroom samples, such as:

- Cap shape, color, and surface  

- Gill size and spacing  

- Odor  

- Spore print color  

- Habitat and population  

- ...and more

Target variable:

- class: edible or poisonous
